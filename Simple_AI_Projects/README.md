## SentimentAnalyzer
This code initializes the VADER sentiment analyzer, analyzes the sentiment of a sample text ("I love this movie! It's so awesome."), prints the sentiment score, and determines the sentiment label (positive, negative, or neutral).

## Image Classification MNIST
This code loads the MNIST dataset, normalizes the pixel values, flattens the images, builds a simple neural network model with one hidden layer, compiles the model, trains it on the training data, evaluates its performance on the test data, and finally, plots a few test images with their predicted labels. 

## FAQ Chatbot
This code defines a basic FAQ chatbot using NLTK for natural language processing. It preprocesses user queries and FAQ data, then generates responses based on pattern matching with the FAQ questions.
